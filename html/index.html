                Weâ€™ve integrated with Nori to offset your Carbon Footprint. <a href="http://nori.com">Read more</a> about how they use blockchain to help reverse climate change. Feel free to use another service like <a href="http://goldstandard.org">Gold Standard</a> if you would like a more traditional offsetting service.

            We want to see a future where Nemo can just keep swimming in coral reefs and penguins can march on ice caps for decades to come. However, these visions are starting to sound truly like a Disney fairytale than our predicted reality. <br /><br />
            We are currently emitting about 45 billion tons of CO2 a year. Your personal Uber history likely contributes ~.000000000025% to total carbon emissions. We want to be clear: offsetting your Ubers will not solve this problem. <br /><br />
            We need dramatic policy changes, large companies committing to going carbon neutral, citizen voices demanding change, and new technology to remove carbon from the air. <a class="dark" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11pfBUnT_4-kgH7_qTwHuRUIS-zsFgY_kCYK8x1Eqpq8">Here is a link</a> to some of our favorite resources to learn more and take action.<br /><br />
            And in the meantime- let's create a climate tweetstorm at Uber to commit to going carbon neutral (like Lyft already has).
